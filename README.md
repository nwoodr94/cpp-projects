# cpp-projects
This is a C++ repository where I will host my scientific works.

### Flight Computer

This project was for my senior capstone at the University of Washington, in 2017. I programmed a scientific payload consisting of an Arduino MEGA and an array of sensors, and validated its capabilities on a sounding rocket.

The computer reads the following physical properties of a typical spaceflight trajectory and writes data to an SD card.

1. Acceleration (x,y,z)
2. Gyroscope (roll,pitch,yaw)
3. Magnetometer (x,y,z)
5. Pressure
6. Temperature
7. Altitude
8. Time
