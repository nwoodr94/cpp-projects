This is a C++ repository where I will host my scientific works.

### Flight Computer

[Scientific Payload](https://github.com/nwoodr94/cpp-projects/blob/master/scientific-payload.cpp) I programmed a scientific payload consisting of an Arduino MEGA, and an array of sensors. This architecture and its capabilities were validated in a field test environment on a sounding rocket.

The computer reads the following physical properties of a typical spaceflight trajectory and writes data to an SD card.

1. Acceleration (x,y,z)
2. Gyroscope (roll,pitch,yaw)
3. Magnetometer (x,y,z)
5. Pressure
6. Temperature
7. Altitude
8. Time


[Space-Daemon](https://github.com/nwoodr94/cpp-projects/blob/master/space-daemon.png) was the multiple stage sounding rocket designed to carry this payload through Mach 2 and to an altitude of 21 km.
